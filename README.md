# CountriesCollection
# Introduction
- Built a countries collection mobile app using Swift and Storyboard. This app fetches a list of countries from web API. When the user clicks on one country, shows the name, capital, code, and population of this country. Allows users to add the country to a favorite list and persist the favorite list in core data.
- This app practiced the knowledge of fetching data from API, navigation between screens, tab bar controller, customized table view, and saving and loading data from core data.
